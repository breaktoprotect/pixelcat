# pixelcat
Transfer files via screens of GUI remote desktop apps (e.g. RDP, VNC, Citrix, etc)

# Note
Currently only the anti-compression mode (-ac) is working fine. The original pixelcat (similar function to ptp-rat) feature may not work on certain resolutions (tested on 3440x1440 and encountered issues).
